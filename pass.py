'''
In Python programming, the pass statement is a null statement which can be used as a placeholder for future code.

Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future. In such cases, we can use the pass statement.

# example with pass statment
n = 10

# use pass inside if statement
if n > 10:
    pass

print('Hello')

n = 10

#if n > 10:
    # write code later

print('Hello')
